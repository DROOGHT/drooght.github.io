    Guillaume is the PI of the DROOGHT project. He tries to understand how plant can better cope with changes in water availability during their growth cycle. To do so, I look at roots, their structure and their organisation . In a wider context, I want to help create sustainable agrosystems that are resilient to drought event and lack of water.
