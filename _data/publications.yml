      Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plays a vital role in global food security, and understanding its root traits is essential for improving water uptake under varying environmental conditions. This study investigated how over a century of breeding has influenced root morphological and hydraulic properties in six German winter wheat cultivars released between 1895 and 2002. Field and hydroponic experiments were used to measure root diameter, root number, branching density, and whole root system hydraulic conductance (Krs). The results showed a significant decline in root axes number and Krs with release year, while root diameter remained stable across cultivars. Additionally, dynamic functional-structural modeling using the whole-plant model CPlantBox was employed to simulate Krs development with root system growth, revealing that older cultivars consistently had higher hydraulic conductance than modern ones. The combined approach of field phenotyping and modeling provided a comprehensive view of the changes in root traits arising from breeding. These findings suggest that breeding may have unintentionally favored cultivars with smaller root systems and more conservative water uptake strategies under the high-input, high-density conditions of modern agriculture. The results of this study may inform future breeding efforts aimed at optimizing wheat root systems, helping to develop cultivars with water uptake strategies better tailored to locally changing environmental conditions.
