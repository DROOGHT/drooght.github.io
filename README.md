<p align="center"> The project DROOGHT aims to identify **root traits** that enhance **crop robustness to drought**. The project focuses on understanding below-ground processes in cereal crops, particularly the role of root diameter distribution in water uptake.</p>

<p align="center"> The project will use both **computational and experimental approaches** to identify dominant structural root traits controlling water uptake under water-limited conditions. The outputs will include a multiscale computational framework, a phenotyping pipeline, and the identification of cereal root properties for robust crop across European conditions and climate change scenarios.</p>

<p align="center"> Overall, the project aims to advance understanding of **root systems' role in water uptake** and provide practical insights for breeders and crop modelers. Over the next 5 years, the project will hire 2 postdoctoral and 4 doctoral researchers.  </p>

<h3 align="center">PhD Researcher in Crop Root Research - DROOGHT_001</h3>

<p align="center">Your goal will be to work on the identification of root traits influencing water dynamics, both in open field, controlled field, and greenhouse conditions. This will be done using the latest root phenotyping tools and techniques developed in the framework of the project.</p>

<p align="center">During your PhD, you will work closely, and be co-supervised by Dominique Mingeot, from the Walloon Center for Agriculture (CRA-W), in Gembloux.</p>

<h3 align="center">Postdoctoral researcher in Root Phenotyping- DROOGHT_002</h3>

<p align="center">Your goal will be to work on the development, validation and deployment of a new model-assisted field root phenotyping pipeline. The aim is to develop an open-source, low-cost and scalable pipeline that will enable large-scale description of root systems across many field setups.</p>

<p align="center">You will closely collaborate with other researchers in the group using the techniques and with the postdoctoral researcher developing the multiscale root modelling framework (offer DROOGHT_003).</p>

<h3 align="center">Postdoctoral researcher in Root Modeling- DROOGHT_003</h3>

<p align="center">Your goal will be to work on the development, validation, and deployment of a new multiscale root modelling pipeline. The framework will combine existing root models, from the organ to the field scale. The aim is to develop an open-source multiscale modeling framework that will allow researchers to explore the effect of specific traits (or combination of traits) on water uptake dynamics in any pedoclimatic conditions.</p>

<p align="center">You will closely collaborate with other researchers in the group using the models and with the postdoctoral researcher developing the model-assisted root phenotyping pipeline (offer DROOGHT_002).</p>
