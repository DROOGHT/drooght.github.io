<p align="center">The project DROOGHT aims to identify root traits that enhance crop robustness to drought. The project focuses on understanding below-ground processes in cereal crops, particularly the role of root diameter distribution in water uptake.  

  

The project will use both computational and experimental approaches to identify dominant structural root traits controlling water uptake under water-limited conditions. The outputs will include a multiscale computational framework, a phenotyping pipeline, and the identification of cereal root properties for robust crop across European conditions and climate change scenarios.  

  

Overall, the project aims to advance understanding of root systems' role in water uptake and provide practical insights for breeders and crop modelers. Over the next 5 years, the project will hire 2 postdoctoral and 4 doctoral researchers.  Stay tuned for job offers. </p>
